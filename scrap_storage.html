As I&rsquo;ve gotten more into quilting, I&rsquo;ve started accumulating scraps of fabric at a faster pace and have found it difficult to keep them organized. The scraps that are really <em>too</em> small get tossed into my &lsquo;stuffing basket&rsquo; and are recycled as stuffing for other projects. But I like to save as much as I can; pieces that are even a couple of inches wide can be useful for little FPP projects. I&rsquo;ve tried wrapping them in bundles, folding them in bins, storing them in colour-coded bags, etc. Nothing <em>stays</em> organized for very long.</p><figure class="right"><img src="/img/print_files.jpg" alt="A package of archival print sleeves for 120 mm negatives resting on a cutting mat." title="A package of archival print sleeves for 120 mm negatives resting on a cutting mat."/> <figcaption>I bought these in another life... or another decade, at least.</figcaption></figure><p>The other day, I remembered I still had an old package of archival sleeves for storing negatives, and, since it might be a while before I had any new negatives to put in them, I wondered if I might be able to use them for my smallest scraps instead. (These sleeves are for medium-format, 120 mm, negatives, so they were the perfect size. Sleeves for 35mm film might have been a bit too small.)</p><p>I sorted the scraps and folded them up so they could slide into the slots, and&hellip; it actually worked out well! After getting all the scraps into sleeves, I was able to fit the sleeves into a 3 inch binder, which I have more confidence in than bins or bags of scraps. I also like that I get a clear view of all my little pieces this way whenever I am looking for scraps for a project.</p><figure class="left"><img src="/img/scraps.jpg" alt="View of several negative sleeves containing brightly coloured fabric scraps arranged on a table.." title="View of several negative sleeves containing brightly coloured fabric scraps arranged on a table."/> <figcaption>The final, super tidy, result!</figcaption></figure><p>For my larger scraps, I think I&rsquo;m going to try a similar approach with regular page protectors.</p></root>
