It&rsquo;s a book full of adorable bag patterns, and I would probably make most of them if I knew where to source that much heavy cotton canvas affordably.</p><figure class="left"><img src="/img/canvas_bag/canvas_bag_1.jpg" alt="Olive green canvas cut out in the shape of a bag pattern resting on a cutting board, with other finished bag pieces (handle, straps, and flap), a book of bag patterns, and a bunch of wonderclips." title="Olive green canvas cut out in the shape of a bag pattern resting on a cutting board, with other finished bag pieces (handle, straps, and flap), a book of bag patterns, and a bunch of wonderclips."/> <img src="/img/canvas_bag/canvas_bag_2.jpg" alt="A close-up of the back of an in-progress olive bag showing straps, handles, and flap pinned in place." title="A close-up of the back of an in-progress olive bag showing straps, handles, and flap pinned in place."/> <img src="/img/canvas_bag/canvas_bag_3.jpg" alt="An image showing the front and lateral pockets pinned in place on an olive green bag body, resting on a cutting board.

It was handy to have some prior experience with things like assembling backpack straps. The heaviest canvas I was able to source locally was only about 350g/m<sup>2</sup>, whereas the pattern called for 500g/m<sup>2</sup>. I think, with the shape and construction of this bag, it didn&rsquo;t end up being a big issue.</p><figure class="left"><img src="/img/canvas_bag/canvas_bag_5.jpg" alt="A close-up showing a patch with a computer and the words 'Computer Club' being stitched onto olive green canvas." title="A close-up showing a patch with a computer and the words 'Computer Club' being stitched onto olive green canvas."/> <img src="/img/canvas_bag/canvas_bag_6.jpg" alt="An image of a white cotton with colourful bicycles printed on it, bordered with a blue cotton on top and bottom, lying diagonally on a cutting board." title="An image of a white cotton with colourful bicycles printed on it, bordered with a blue cotton on top and bottom, lying diagonally on a cutting board."/> <img src="/img/canvas_bag/canvas_bag_7.jpg" alt="An image showing the completed bag lining with interior pocket sewn in place." title="An image showing the completed bag lining with interior pocket sewn in place."/> <img src="/img/canvas_bag/canvas_bag_8.jpg" alt="An image showing the bag lining clipped to the bag exterior, ready to be sewn in place." title="An image showing the bag lining clipped to the bag exterior, ready to be sewn in place."/></figure><p>I colour-blocked the lining because I only had a quarter metre of this perfect bicycle print cotton, which wasn&rsquo;t quite enough for the lining piece. I also made a measuring error when drawing out the bag exterior pattern pieces, and ended up cutting each of them 1 centimetre too small. When I started sewing the bag body, I realized this meant that there wouldn&rsquo;t be enough clearance for the flap. This is why there is a cute dart on the flap &mdash; not only as a brilliant design choice, but also to reduce it&rsquo;s width so that it wouldn&rsquo;t get caught in the body side seam allowance.</p><figure class="left"><img src="/img/canvas_bag/canvas_bag_9.jpg" alt="A close-up of an eyelet being hand-stitched." title="A close-up of an eyelet being hand-stitched."/> <img src="/img/canvas_bag/canvas_bag_10.jpg" alt="An olive green canvas backpack resting on a cutting board on the floor." title="An olive green canvas backpack resting on a cutting board on the floor."/></figure><p>I substituted a magentic clasp for the flap rivet buttons, and hand-stitched the 12 eyelets for the cord. I think when I make this bag again, I might also substitute a webbing with a pretty weave for the straps.</p></root>
